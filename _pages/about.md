## About the Lab

How is it that we can process the same information in different ways at different times? Humans have a remarkable ability to process inputs from the environment flexibly. Our lab is interested in understanding what brain mechanisms underlie this ability. Evidence suggests that the brainâ€™s state before a stimulus is presented may impact the way the stimulus is processed at the time and remembered in the future. We use a variety of tools to better understand this effect. We study human behavior and brain activity using precise behavioral measurements (including psychophysics and tracking of eye movement), functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and electroencephalography (EEG).

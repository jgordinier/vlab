In order to understand how the brain gives rise to behavior, we have to get a handle on behavior! One way is to use techniques from [**psychophysics**](http://www.uni-leipzig.de/~isp/isp/history/explanation.htm) in which we carefully constrain and modulate the stimuli and measure subjects behavior as a function of those stimuli.

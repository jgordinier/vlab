### Research Focus

The lab's focus is on how intrinsic, ongoing brain activity impacts subjects' behavior. Our research addresses three interrelated questions:  

Ongoing activity in sensory regions: How does ongoing activity in sensory regions change with attention? Do the same processes occur for visual and auditory stimuli? We use EEG and fMRI methods to address this question.  

Comparisons across groups: How does ongoing brain activity shift as people age? Does this correlate with age-related declines in performance?  

How does our ability to manipulate intrinsic, ongoing activity change with experience, such as training or loss of vision.  

We use methods of EEG, fMRI, and behavior to address these questions.

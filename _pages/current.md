The work in my lab at UAB has integrated my previous work examining the neural basis of cognitive control (using functional magnetic resonance imaging, fMRI) and my work reflecting how sensory representations are influenced by context (using behavioral/psychophysics methods, as well as the neuroimaging methods EEG and fMRI).  My overarching research interest is to understand how cognitive control mechanisms affect sensory processing, and how this cognitive control is modified by experience.

I am interested in retinotopy in individuals with macular degeneration. Retinotopy describes the neatly organized mapping of visual input from the eye to the brain. I use fMRI to see if losing central vision changes the organization of activity and physical characteristics of the brain, such as thickness.

The research I am doing involves training people with healthy vision to better use their peripheral vision. I am interested in whether visual training  influences the way people use their attention during a visual task. I am also interested in what changes take place in the brain following training.

I am interested in studying how aging impacts brain structure and function. Specifically why cognitive abilities decrease as we get older, how much the older brain can be trained, and what role genetics plays in all of this. I want to be able to understand how the relationship between aging and the brain could help aid in reducing risks for age-associated neurological diseases and disorders.

I research healthy aging in an 85+ population of mentally and physically healthy adults. I am interested in how brain regions are physically connected to one anther, the validity of psychological tests in older populations, and how the brain can be resilient to the effects of aging and diseases associated with age.

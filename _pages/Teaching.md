## Courses

Here is some information about courses taught by Kristina Visscher.  

**Systems Neuroscience**  
Taught in the spring. GBSC 727  
This course covers basic systems neuroscience concepts for first year neuroscience graduate students.  

**Methods in Neuroimaging**  
Taught in Fall. NBL 743 (graduate student version) NBL 420 (undergraduate version).  
Cognitive neuroscience research has provided valuable insights into the workings of the human brain. The techniques used in cognitive neuroscience span from postmortem brain studies to neuroimaging studies. The ability to perform neuroimaging studies on awake human individuals engaged in cognitive, social, sensory, and motor tasks has produced a conceptual revolution in the study of human cognition. This course will comprehensively examine the methods and techniques in neuroimaging with the primary goal of building basic knowledge in the concepts and techniques of neuroimaging. The course will explore techniques, such as single and multi cell recordings, deep brain stimulation, electroencephalography, magnetoencephalography, functional magnetic resonance imaging, and diffusion tensor imaging. This course will be an apt venue for graduate students interested in neuroscience research to build a platform for continuing studies. The figure (left panel below) plots the sizes and time scales at which we can examine brain function. This course will focus on structure and function of neurons and groups of neurons. The second figure (right panel) shows where a few neuroimaging methods fall on that plot. These give a sense of the range of levels over which we can study the brain.  

**Scientific Reasoning and Medical Research Design**
Taught in Spring, every other year. NBL 210  
The goal of this course is to teach biomedical research design basics and critical thinking skills in the context of neuroscience research.  This knowledge should be helpful for understanding and conducting scientific research, as well as for the updated sections of the 2015 MCAT test for medical school admission.  

Previous Courses:

**Graduate Neuroscience Discussion**  
Co-taught with Gwendalyn King in Spring. GBS 791(graduate student version) NBL 420 (undergraduate version)  

**Goals:**  
1 – Exposure to a wide range of basic neuroscience research topics, generally following along with the themes discussed in GBS 732  
2 – Exposure to lecture development.  
3 – Promote discussion skills and critical thinking skills.
